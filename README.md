Linear Regression Model Optimization

Welcome to the Linear Regression Model Optimization project! In this project, you will be optimizing a linear regression model using gradient descent to predict TV sales. This README file will guide you through the project resources and provide essential instructions to get started.
Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin working on the project:

    Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from the provided link. Make sure to make a copy first.

    Notebook: Inside the repository, you will find a Jupyter notebook containing all the necessary instructions and code snippets. Open the notebook in your preferred environment.

    Data Set: The project provides a dataset required for training the linear regression model. Ensure that you have access to the dataset.

Instructions

The notebook contains detailed instructions for completing the project. Here's a brief overview:

    Linear Regression Model Optimization: Implement gradient descent to optimize the linear regression model. Follow the instructions in the notebook, and complete the code snippets as required.

    Unit Tests: The notebook includes unit tests to validate your implementations. Make sure to pass all the tests before proceeding.

    Exercises: Complete the five exercises provided in the notebook. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of optimizing the linear regression model.

    Decision Trees and Random Forests: Additionally, you will create decision trees and random forests models. Compare the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSE) of these models with the linear regression model and rank them accordingly.

Note

    Pay close attention to the instructions provided in the notebook.
    Make sure to complete all the required code snippets and exercises.
    Test your implementations using the provided unit tests.
    Ensure that you have all necessary dependencies installed in your environment.

Conclusion

Upon completing the project, you will have gained valuable experience in optimizing linear regression models using gradient descent and comparing them with decision trees and random forests. Have fun exploring and optimizing your models!
